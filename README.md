# AI-Generated-Response-Classifier
The aim of this project was to determine the most accurate machine learning model for predicting the target values of newly generated chatbot responses. The primary goal was to evaluate and compare the performance of various classification models to identify which model best predicted the categories or intent behind chatbot responses. These models were trained on a dataset that included both primary features and target values, and the project focused on fine-tuning the algorithms to optimize their performance for predicting unseen data. Through data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, stop-word removal, and feature vectorization, the models were trained and evaluated, providing insights into which machine learning approach offered the most accurate predictions for chatbot responses
